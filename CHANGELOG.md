## v1.0.3 (01/08/20)
- Added a Dockerfile
- Changed constant `VERSION` in routes/stats.go

## v1.0.2 (27/5/2020)

## v1.0.1 (20/5/2020)
- Documented recommended avatar sizes for each endpoint.
- Added `goroutines` field in `/stats`
- Improved `/picture` and `/bobross` slightly, increased image height. More height will be cut but this way the width is more balanced so the image is less streched and looks better.
